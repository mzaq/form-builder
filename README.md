## Form Builder

Simple React front-end project that mimics behaviour of a more robust app in which user could build complex forms including conditional subinputs, generate the form markup, take a look at a form preview etc.

#### In this app you are able to:

- create/edit/delete new 'form-building' instances,
- add/edit/delete various types of inputs and conditional subinputs

#### Functionalities:

- inputs dynamic offset
- focusing single input highlights it's parent and it's direct childs

---

I'm not really sure whether the data structure type I choosed for the inputs suits the purpose of it.  
There's a lot of:

```js
[...someArray].map();
[...anotherArray].filter();
[...yetAnotherOne].reduce();
```

So.. please feel free to file some issues. Thanks!
