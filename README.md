## Form Builder

Simple React front-end project that mimics behaviour of a more robust app in which user could build complex forms including conditional subinputs, generate the form markup, take a look at a preview etc.

#### Here you can:

- create/edit/delete new 'form-building' instances,
- add/edit/delete various types of inputs and conditional subinputs

#### Functionalities:

- inputs dynamic offsset
- focusing single input highlights it's parent and it's direct childs

---

I'm not really sure whether the data structure type I choosed for the inputs suits the purpose of it.
There's a lot of:

```js
[...someArray].map();
[...anotherArray].filter();
[...yetAnotherOne].reduce();
```

Anyway, please feel free to file a issue. Thanks!
